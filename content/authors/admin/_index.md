The Caterpillar project a state-of-the-art cosmological simulation suite consisting of dark matter halos of mass similar to that of our own Milky Way. 

The full Caterpillar catalogue consists of ~40 dark matter halos at a particle resolution of ∼10<sup>4</sup> M<sub>⊙</sub> making it one of the largest and highest resolution simulation suites of its kind in the world to date. These data are enabling us to statistically probe the formation history and evolution of all galaxies of similar size to the Milky Way, including the Milky Way itself!

All of following information is detailed in our flagship paper [Griffen et al. (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/bib_query?arXiv:1509.01255).
